    "# Assignment 8: Automated Machine Learning (Part 2)\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned from the class, the high demand for machine learning has produced a large amount of data scientists who have developed expertise in tools and algorithms. The features in the data will directly influence the results. However, it is tedious and unscalable to manually design and select features without domain knowledge. Thus, using some AutoML techniques will significantly help data scientists save labour and time. \n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do we need AutoML?\n",
    "2. How does auto feature generation work?\n",
    "3. How to use featuretools library to automatically generate features?\n",
    "4. How to get useful features in a large feature space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a data scientist in an online retailer company, for example, Amazon. Your task is to provide some recommendations to customers based on their historical purchase records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we predict whether the customer will buy **Banana** in the next 4 weeks. It is a classification problem. To simplify the problem, we have already generated some features and provide the accuracy of the model (Random Forest model). The task for you is to generate **10** useful features and beat our model performance (AUC = 0.61, see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, <br>\n",
    "`MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Bag of Organic Bananas` means whether the most frequent purchase of the customer is Bag of Organic Bananas. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Bag of Organic Bananas\n",
    "2: Feature: MODE(order_products.aisle_id) is unknown\n",
    "3: Feature: SUM(orders.NUM_UNIQUE(order_products.product_name))\n",
    "4: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.product_name)) = Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts\n",
    "5: Feature: MODE(order_products.product_name) = Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts\n",
    "6: Feature: STD(orders.NUM_UNIQUE(order_products.aisle_id))\n",
    "7: Feature: MODE(order_products.aisle_id) = 83\n",
    "8: Feature: MEDIAN(orders.MINUTE(order_time))\n",
    "9: Feature: MODE(orders.DAY(order_time)) = 23\n",
    "10: Feature: MODE(orders.MODE(order_products.department)) = produce\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC 0.61\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary\n",

    "    - Allows to setup relationships between entities if exists.\n",
    "    - Automatically generates complex features and improves the predictive performance of the model.\n",
    "    - Makes feature engineering faster and easier which reduces the development time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - It does not work on simple data set or where there is no parent/child relationship.\n",
    "    - Feature tools can run only data sets that can fit in memory on one machine.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. If there is no relationships between datasets(in some cases) then it is better to use other feature engineering techniques. Increase memory to fit the data such that feature tool can be applied."
